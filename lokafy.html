							<h1 class="hvr-underline-from-left-enthus">Lokafy Automated Booking Platform</h>
							<h2>Problem:</h2>
							<ul>
							  <li>Remote team on two continents required online documents (ex. Google Spreadsheets). These documents had so many formulas and too much information that they constantly failed. This would delay work and waste important work hours.</li>
							  <li>Manual labour in sending emails and updating spreadsheets took too much time.</li>
							  <li>Bookings were being missed or handled too late because emails were being overlooked.</li>
							  <li>Local guides were unavailable because we were not asking for their availability in advance. This forced us to find new locals with sometimes less than 24 hours notice.</li>
							  <li>Travellers missed their tour because they did not receive a confirmation email from us.</li>
							</ul>
							<h2>User Interviews:</h2>
							<h3>As an internal product, it was important to speak with the team to understand what needed to be built to assist with the operations process. As it was a small team, group meetings could be conducted to discuss what components were the most important.</h3>
							<h2>Solution:</h2>
							<h3>A booking management system that would log all new bookings and send emails automatically to the travellers (confirmations) and the local guides (availability). It would also act as a database for a variety of information including: customer data, local guides data, and operational cities.</h3>
							<h2>Results:</h2>
							<h3>The booking management system was a necessary step in the expansion of Lokafy. Remote associates were able to access bookings with ease and speed. Bookings were never missed as they were being logged as soon as they were received. In addition, we were able to work a month in advance and were allowed more time to hire new locals and therefore expand our network of locals. With a larger network of locals, each booking became easier to finalize and we were able to provide a better experience for the travellers.</h3>
							<h3><b>Key Metrics:</b></h3>
							<ul>
							  <li>40% decrease in cancellations</li>
							  <li>30% increase in local network</li>
							</ul>
							<h3>The booking management system that I developed was not only great at solving our most immediate problems, but it could be transformed in the future to provide a better experience for both the company and the travellers. Future additions could include automatic payment system to the locals to pay them without delays; added reviews from travellers to select the best local and dismiss poor ones; and a questionnaire to the travellers to make sure we select the right local for the tour. This system has the potential for even more features that could greatly benefit the company and its growth.</h3>
